The year **2004** marked a historic milestone, with critically acclaimed performances in **YUVA**, **HUM TUM**, and **VEER-ZAARA**, earning her Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards simultaneously across major award platforms.

## Critical Acclaim and Legacy Roles
Her performance in **BLACK (2005)** is considered one of the finest in Indian cinema, earning her sweeping critical and mainstream accolades. She continued to balance commercial and artistic cinema with films like **KABHI ALVIDA NAA KEHNA (2006)**, **TA RA RUM PUM (2007)**, **NO ONE KILLED JESSICA (2011)** and **TALAASH (2012)**.

The **MARDAANI** franchise established her as the face of India’s most successful female-led action series. Her portrayal of Shivani Shivaji Roy is regarded as iconic.

## Recent Work and Future Projects

## Technical –

Mandate and Scope
The Technical division at Yash Raj Films works closely with the film distribution team to enable digital cinema content distribution for new theatrical releases across India and international markets. Its responsibilities span critical post-production functions that support the final delivery of films for theatrical exhibition.

Digital Cinema and Post-Production Coordination
A core responsibility of the division is the coordination of laboratory workflows and Digital Intermediate (DI) processes that are intrinsic to any film’s theatrical release. This coordination ensures that technical deliverables meet required quality standards and timelines for domestic and overseas distribution.

Digitisation and Restoration of Film Catalogue
Over the past several years, the Technical division has led the digitisation of YRF’s legacy content originally available in analogue formats. In addition, the team has successfully completed digital restoration of the entire YRF film catalogue.

Through these efforts, YRF became among the early studios in the industry to make its catalogue available in High Definition, enabling further digital exploitation and satellite release.

In-House Technical Capabilities
While many production houses rely on third-party vendors for format conversions, transfers, and subtitle spotting, YRF has developed in-house capabilities to handle a majority of these technical requirements. This internal expertise supports greater control over quality, timelines, and content security.

Content Archiving and Asset Management
The Technical division plays a central role in managing and maintaining YRF’s archives. This includes:

- Collating and preserving stock shots sourced from film negatives
- Structuring archival assets for accessibility and reuse
- Supporting interdepartmental content requirements

Streamlining the archiving process remains foundational to enabling efficient operations across the company.

Cross-Departmental Enablement
By maintaining a centralized and well-organized archive, the Technical division functions as a key enabler for multiple departments, ensuring that content assets are readily accessible for production, marketing, distribution, and other internal needs.

Continuous Technical Evolution
The division operates in a rapidly evolving technical landscape. It remains a continuous priority for the team to stay aligned with advancements in digital cinema, post-production technologies, and archival practices to support current and future industry standards.

## Brand Partnerships

Brand Partnerships is the division within Yash Raj Films (YRF) that unlocks strategic and commercial value for global and domestic brands by integrating them meaningfully across the studio’s films, content, and creative ecosystem.

The division is designed to move beyond traditional advertising and transactional placements, focusing instead on organic, story-led brand immersion that aligns with narrative, audience relevance, and long-term brand value.

Brand Partnerships functions as a stable revenue pillar for YRF, often insulated from the volatility of theatrical box office performance. It enables diversified income streams through endorsements, licensing, co-branded content, and cross-platform collaborations while reinforcing the YRF stamp of quality.

The division works across the full spectrum of YRF productions—ranging from large-scale tent-pole franchises to content-driven films and digital-first originals—ensuring brand associations are authentic, impactful, and commercially effective.

- Digital-first and streaming content including BANG BAAJA BAARAAT, 6-PACK BAND, LOVE SHOTS, music videos, and original digital series

The division adopts a 360-degree partnership strategy, leveraging YRF’s vertically integrated studio ecosystem to build deep, multi-platform brand narratives rather than one-off promotions.

## Live Events

Yash Raj Films is one of India’s largest film studios, with a long-standing presence across cinema, music, and talent-driven storytelling. The studio’s expansion into live theatrical formats represents an extension of its core storytelling philosophy into experiential and stage-based entertainment.

Transition from Film to Stage
Building on the legacy of _Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge_, Chopra has expanded the narrative universe of the film into live musical theatre. His work in this space reflects a creative belief that Indian cinema and musical theatre share foundational similarities, particularly in their use of music and dance to convey emotion and storytelling.

Creative Collaboration
The production brings together a diverse, international creative team drawn from film and musical theatre, including:

- Original story direction by Aditya Chopra
- Book and lyrics by Nell Benjamin
- Music composition by Vishal Dadlani and Sheykhar Ravjiani
- Choreography by Rob Ashford
- Associate choreography and Indian dance by Shruti Merchant
- Scenic design by Derek McLane

This collaboration reflects a deliberate fusion of Eastern and Western creative traditions.

Narrative and Thematic Focus
The musical presents a contemporary romantic narrative centered on identity, tradition, and personal choice. Set across Europe and India, the story explores cultural intersection through original music and stage performance, featuring eighteen newly composed songs.

Strategic Significance
YRF’s live events initiatives demonstrate the studio’s intent to:

- Extend film intellectual property into new entertainment formats
- Engage global audiences through live performance
- Explore cross-cultural storytelling at scale

## Licensing

The Licensing division of Yash Raj Films (YRF) is responsible for the protection, control, and monetization of the company’s intellectual property portfolio under the provisions of the Copyright Act. The division ensures that YRF’s content is commercially exploited across authorized platforms while safeguarding the studio’s legal and creative ownership rights.

The licensing mandate spans a wide range of content formats and rights, including but not limited to:

- Films and film titles
- Soundtracks and individual music tracks
- Song videos and audio-visual assets
- Dialogues, lyrics, and scripts
- Photographs and stills
- Film-related creative properties

Any use of YRF-owned intellectual property by external parties—whether individuals, corporate entities, or government organizations—requires prior authorization through a formal licensing agreement executed on commercially acceptable terms.

YRF licenses its content across multiple mediums, including:

- Television broadcasters
- Radio networks
- Consumer products and merchandise
- Films and in-film usage
- Print and digital media
- Public performance environments

Public Performance Licenses cover usage in hotels, restaurants, retail outlets, events, ground activations, and other public establishments.

The Licensing division has executed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with the majority of television channels and radio broadcasters in India, enabling structured and mutually agreed usage of YRF’s content at predefined licensing fees.

In addition, the division has issued licenses for:

- Cross-brand integrations
- In-film and promotional usage
- Commercial exploitation by external brands

In many such partnerships, YRF’s content plays a central role in enhancing brand visibility and consumer engagement.

Public Performance Licenses are administered through YRF’s authorized agency, **Novex**, which manages licensing and compliance for public usage of YRF’s audio and video repertoire.

With increasing demand for licensed audio-visual content across traditional, digital, and experiential platforms, the Licensing division serves as a key revenue-generation vertical for YRF. It enables systematic monetization of the studio’s extensive content library while maintaining legal integrity and brand consistency.

Licensing operations are centrally managed from Mumbai, ensuring coordination across legal, commercial, and creative functions.

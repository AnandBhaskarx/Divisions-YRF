## Film Production

Yash Raj Films maintains a robust in-house production team optimized to produce 6 to 7 films annually. The infrastructure is designed for scalability, allowing for increased annual output to meet market demand. To date, the studio has produced a library exceeding 80 feature films.

Films produced under the YRF banner consistently command peak market values across multiple revenue streams, including:

- Domestic and International Distributors
- Exhibitors and Theatre Chains
- Satellite and Terrestrial Broadcast Channels
- Global Licensees and Catalogue Repertoire Users

YRF holds the distinction of filming in the highest number of international locations among Indian production houses. This global approach has directly influenced international tourism:

- **Strategic Impact**: The studio's long-standing association with Switzerland, pioneered by Mr. Yash Chopra, serves as a primary case study for film-induced tourism.
- **Pioneering Locations**: YRF has successfully executed shoots in territories previously untapped by Indian cinema, including Cuba, Brazil, Namibia, Croatia, Ireland, and Portugal.
- **Institutional Relations**: The studio maintains active engagement with global tourism offices seeking to host YRF productions.

The studio prioritizes high-tier production values, focusing on "look, feel, and technique" comparable to global Hollywood standards. Key technical benchmarks include:

- _WAR_ and _WAR 2_
- _PATHAAN_
- _TIGER 3_ and _TIGER ZINDA HAI_
- _DHOOM:3_
- _THUGS OF HINDOSTAN_

YRF provides specialized line production services for international projects. A notable collaboration includes the production of the major Chinese feature film, _Buddies in India_.

The studio's roadmap involves increasing annual output under the YRF banner while utilizing **YRF Studios** to back a diverse portfolio of films across multiple genres. Every production is mandated to maintain the "YRF stamp of quality" and compete as top-tier annual releases.

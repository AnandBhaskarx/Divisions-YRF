## Digital & New Media

The Digital & New Media division of Yash Raj Films (YRF) is responsible for driving the studio’s digital-first strategy, managing global digital distribution, and building scalable digital revenue streams while strengthening YRF’s brand presence across platforms.

YRF has consistently been at the forefront of digital innovation within the Indian entertainment industry. The studio was among the first film production companies in India to:

- Launch its own official website (1997)
- Deploy films and music within the early digital ecosystem
- Leverage digital platforms as both a communication medium and a revenue engine

This early adoption established YRF as a digital pioneer long before digital consumption became mainstream.

The Digital & New Media division oversees:

- Global digital distribution of YRF content
- Music rights management and monetization
- Deployment of full-length films on streaming platforms
- Digital rights management (DRM)
- Licensing of audio and video content
- Digital community building and audience engagement

The division’s objective is to ensure consistent, controlled, and optimized digital exploitation of YRF’s content catalogue worldwide.

Beyond distribution and monetization, the division focuses on:

- Strengthening YRF’s digital brand identity
- Building long-term audience communities
- Enhancing engagement across music, film, and promotional content

This integrated approach enables YRF to remain culturally relevant while expanding its digital footprint.

YRF has continually demonstrated readiness to scale into emerging digital formats and platforms. The division plays a key role in identifying and operationalizing new digital opportunities, ensuring YRF remains future-facing in an evolving media landscape.

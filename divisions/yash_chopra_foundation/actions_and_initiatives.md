The Yash Chopra Foundation has undertaken multiple initiatives to support film industry workers, particularly during periods of heightened vulnerability.

Key initiatives include:

- Home delivery of ration supplies to film workers during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
- Direct benefit transfers for women and senior citizens during COVID-19
- Supply of cooked meals to quarantine centres from the YRF Studios kitchen
- COVID-19 vaccination support, including transport and vaccine awareness
- Benefits under the YCF Saathi program, including ration support, travel reimbursement, healthcare, and education assistance
- Introduction of enrolment categories for retired and specially-abled film industry workers in 2024
- Quarterly awareness sessions covering career counselling, financial planning, and healthcare topics

These initiatives reflect YCF’s commitment to both immediate relief and long-term support.

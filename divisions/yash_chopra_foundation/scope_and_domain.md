## Scope and Domain

Film industry workers and labourers have played a continuous and integral role in building the legacy of Yash Raj Films since its inception in 1970 under the leadership of the late Yash Chopra.

The Yash Chopra Foundation acknowledges this contribution by extending focused support to daily wage workers who require sustained livelihood assistance.

Through minimum basic support and long-term engagement mechanisms such as the Saathi Card, YCF aims to enable stability, dignity, and future readiness for beneficiaries and their families.

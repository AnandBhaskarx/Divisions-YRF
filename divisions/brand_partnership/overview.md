## Brand Partnerships – Overview

## Division Mandate
Brand Partnerships is the division within Yash Raj Films that unlocks strategic value for brands, clients, and partners by integrating them meaningfully across YRF’s films, content, and creative ecosystem.

This division works across the full spectrum of YRF productions—ranging from large-scale tent-pole franchises to content-driven films and digital-first originals—ensuring brand associations are impactful, authentic, and commercially effective.

## Scope of Partnerships
Brand Partnerships spans across YRF’s most iconic and commercially successful properties, including:
- Major franchises and blockbusters such as **WAR**, **TIGER ZINDA HAI**, **SULTAN**, **BEFIKRE**, and the **DHOOM** franchise  
- Content-driven and youth-centric films like **SUI DHAAGA**, **HICHKI**, **DUM LAGA KE HAISHA**, and **MERE DAD KI MARUTI**  
- Digital-first and streaming content including **BANG BAAJA BAARAAT**, **6-PACK BAND**, **LOVE SHOTS**, and music videos  

## Strategic Approach
The division goes beyond traditional in-film or out-film placements that are often transactional in nature. Instead, it adopts a **360-degree partnership strategy**, leveraging YRF’s end-to-end studio ecosystem to build deep, multi-platform brand integrations.

Brand Partnerships works collaboratively across:
- Film production and storytelling  
- Digital platforms and content  
- Distribution and release strategies  
- Design and creative assets  
- Talent associations  
- Merchandising and licensing  
- Music and home entertainment  
- Studio infrastructure and IP  

This integrated approach allows partnerships to evolve into long-term brand narratives and industry case studies rather than one-off promotions.

## Landmark Brand Collaborations
YRF has delivered several benchmark partnerships, including:
- Global automotive integrations such as **BMW motorcycles** and **Audi cars** in *WAR*  
- **PepsiCo Foods’ Mountain Dew**, including the creation of a co-branded beverage for *DHOOM:3*  
- A full-fledged brand film **MERE DAD KI MARUTI**, created for *Maruti Suzuki Ertiga*  
- Multiple organic, story-driven brand associations within *SULTAN*  

Each partnership is driven by innovation, quality execution, and narrative relevance—capabilities enabled by YRF’s position as a full-service studio.

## Partnership Philosophy
Innovation, creative integrity, and execution excellence define all brand collaborations at YRF. The division focuses on ideas that are:
- Story-led  
- Audience-relevant  
- Scalable across platforms  
- Aligned with the film or content universe  

This ensures brand integrations feel organic, meaningful, and impactful rather than interruptive.

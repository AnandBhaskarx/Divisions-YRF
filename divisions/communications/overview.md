## Communications –

The Communications team at Yash Raj Films is committed to delivering accurate, honest, and consistent messaging across the company’s diverse portfolio of films, talent, and creative ventures. The function exists to ensure that YRF’s work, achievements, and ongoing initiatives are clearly and responsibly represented to both internal and external stakeholders.

YRF’s films, projects, and talent attract significant interest and coverage across media platforms in India and internationally. The Communications team serves as the primary interface with print, broadcast, and digital media, ensuring that information is shared with clarity, relevance, and appropriate context.

By proactively engaging with media and audiences, the team ensures that key developments are communicated in a structured and focused manner, aligned with the studio’s values and creative objectives.

Each YRF film is supported by a dedicated communications effort designed to present its creative intent, scale, and execution accurately. This includes:

- Managing public relations and media narratives
- Highlighting the creative contributions of cast and crew
- Ensuring consistent messaging across suitable media platforms

The overarching objective is to manage a film’s public image with clarity, directness, and creativity while maintaining factual integrity.

In collaboration with YRF Talent, the Communications team supports the public presence of actors and performers represented by the studio. As talent progresses in their careers, communications efforts focus on:

- Sharing verified updates on achievements and projects
- Engaging responsibly with fan communities
- Managing media interactions related to individual artistes

Maintaining a clear and authentic public image for each talent is a key responsibility, executed across print, broadcast, and digital channels.

A core function of the Communications team is the timely clarification of media enquiries. Queries from journalists and media stakeholders are addressed promptly to ensure accurate dissemination of information and to prevent misinterpretation or misinformation.

Beyond external outreach, Communications also manages the flow of verified information within YRF. This includes:

- Press-related communications
- Corporate updates
- Information relevant to multiple business verticals

The team coordinates closely with internal departments to ensure alignment and consistency in all outward-facing communication.

As a studio that has pioneered films across genres, scale, and storytelling formats, YRF places strong emphasis on factual and relevant communication. The Communications function plays a central role in representing the studio’s activities, milestones, and initiatives with accuracy and clarity.

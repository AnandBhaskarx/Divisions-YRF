## YRF IP Licensing FAQs


General Licensing Questions

Q1: What exactly is IP licensing in the context of YRF?

**IP Licensing means:** YRF grants you the right to use our intellectual property (characters, film titles, music, logos, imagery) to create and sell products or experiences, in exchange for fees and/or royalties.

**What you can license:**

- **Characters:** Tiger, Pathaan, Kabir (Spy Universe), other film characters
- **Film Titles & Imagery:** Use film names, posters, iconic scenes on products
- **Music:** YRF songs for use in products, apps, or experiences
- **YRF Brand:** YRF logo for entertainment-related products
- **Franchises:** Dhoom, Tiger series, etc.

**What you can't do without a license:**

- Manufacture products featuring YRF IP
- Use YRF characters in your content/games
- Use YRF music in commercial applications
- Create derivative works based on YRF properties

**Why licensing benefits you:**

- Access to established, beloved IP with built-in audience
- Marketing advantage of recognized brands
- Cross-promotion opportunities during film releases
- Association with premium Bollywood entertainment brand

 Q2: What's the difference between licensing and a brand partnership?

**Key Differences:**

IP Licensing grants you the right to use YRF's intellectual property on products you manufacture and sell, with a revenue model where you pay YRF a minimum guarantee plus royalties, typically under 3-5 year ongoing agreements. In contrast, brand partnerships provide brand visibility within YRF films or campaigns, with revenue models involving partnership fees or joint investments, usually for film-specific timelines of 6-12 months. With licensing, you create products using YRF IP, such as action figures, apparel, or mobile games, while partnerships involve your existing product appearing in films, like car brands or fashion integrations.

**Can you do both?** Yes! A brand partner can also become an IP licensee. Example: Apparel brand partners on a film AND licenses character designs for a clothing line.

Q3: How does YRF select licensing partners?

**YRF Licensing Evaluation Criteria:**

**1. Brand Quality & Reputation:**

- Is your brand reputable and financially stable?

**5. Creative Vision:**

- How well do you understand the IP?

- Willingness to collaborate on product design

**6. Category Fit:**

- Is your product category appropriate for YRF IP?
- Category availability (not already exclusively licensed)
- Strategic fit with YRF licensing goals

**Red Flags (likely to be declined):**

- Poor product quality in past ventures
- Financial instability
- Misalignment with YRF family-friendly brand values

## Commercial Terms and Agreements
Q7: What is a Minimum Guarantee (MG) and why is it required?

**Minimum Guarantee (MG) Definition:**

The MG is an **upfront payment** that guarantees YRF will receive at least a certain amount, regardless of your product sales performance. It's standard in licensing agreements.

**How MG Works:**

**Example Scenario:**

- MG: ₹1 crore
- Royalty Rate: 10% of net sales
- Your Product Sales (Year 1): ₹8 crore net
- Royalty Owed: ₹80 lakh (10% of ₹8 crore)

**Since MG (₹1 crore) > Royalty Owed (₹80 lakh):**

- You pay no additional royalty in Year 1
- The ₹20 lakh difference can often be "banked" for future years (recoupable)

**If Sales Exceed MG:**

- Your sales generate ₹12 crore net
- Royalty Owed: ₹1.2 crore
- Since this exceeds MG (₹1 crore), you pay additional ₹20 lakh

**Why MG is Required:**

**For YRF:**

- Guarantees minimum return on valuable IP
- Compensates for exclusivity granted
- Ensures licensee is serious and committed
- Protects against poor execution or market performance

**For You:**

- Secures exclusive rights in your category
- Acts as pre-payment against future royalties (recoupable)
- Demonstrates commitment and financial capacity

**MG is typically:**

- Paid upon contract signing (full amount or installments)
- Non-refundable
- Recoupable against royalties over contract term
- Varies by IP value, category, territory, exclusivity

---

Q8: How are royalty rates determined?

**Royalty Rate Factors:**

**1. Product Category:**

- **High-margin products (8-10% royalty):** Mass-market toys, basic apparel
- **Mid-margin products (10-12%):** Premium toys, fashion, accessories
- **Premium products (12-15%):** Luxury items, high-end collectibles, gaming

**2. IP Strength:**

- **Premium IP** (Spy Universe, active franchises): Higher rates
- **Classic IP** (older films, nostalgia): Moderate rates
- **Supporting characters/elements**: Lower rates

**3. Territory:**

- **India only:** Standard rates
- **India + select markets:** Slight premium
- **Worldwide:** Significant premium (may add 20-30% to MG)

**4. Exclusivity:**

- **Category exclusive:** Standard rates
- **Non-exclusive:** Lower rates (but rare)

**5. Sales Volume Potential:**

- Higher projected volumes may allow lower percentage but larger absolute royalty

**Royalty Calculation Base:**

**Net Sales = Gross Sales minus:**

- Returns and allowances
- Trade discounts (genuine, pre-approved)
- Taxes (GST, VAT, sales tax)
- Freight (if separately billed to customer)

**Not deductible:**

- Manufacturing costs
- Marketing expenses
- Distributor margins (internal)
- Overhead

**Reporting & Payment:**

- Quarterly sales reports required
- Royalty payments due within 30 days of quarter-end
- Annual audit rights for YRF
- Accurate record-keeping mandatory

---

Q9: What does "category exclusivity" mean in licensing?

**Category Exclusivity Definition:**

When YRF grants you category exclusivity, we agree NOT to license the same IP to competing products in your category during your contract term.

**Example:**

- You license Tiger character for **action figures**
- Category: "Action figures and collectible toys"
- **Exclusivity means:** YRF won't license Tiger to another action figure manufacturer during your term

**What's Included in Your Category:**

- Defined clearly in contract
- Example: "3.75-inch to 12-inch poseable action figures"

**What's NOT Restricted (Different Categories):**

- Other toy categories: Board games, plush toys, puzzles
- Apparel featuring Tiger
- Tiger video games
- Tiger in theme park attractions

**Benefits of Exclusivity:**

**For You:**

- No direct competition from other Tiger action figures
- Market protection in your category
- Stronger retail positioning
- Justifies your investment in molds, marketing

**For YRF:**

- Ensures focused, high-quality execution
- Avoids market confusion
- Allows licensee to maximize category potential

**Exclusivity Implications:**

**Higher MG:** Typically 20-40% premium over non-exclusive
**Performance Requirements:** You must meet minimum sales thresholds
**Use It or Lose It:** If you don't actively market products, YRF may have rights to terminate exclusivity

**Multi-Category Exclusivity:**

- You can license multiple categories (toys + apparel + accessories)
- Each adds to MG and royalty obligations
- Demonstrates commitment and capability

**Territory Exclusivity:**

- Often combined with category exclusivity
- Example: Exclusive action figure rights for India
- Prevents YRF from licensing to competitors in that territory + category

---

Q10: Can I sub-license the IP to third parties?

**Generally, NO. Sub-licensing is typically restricted.**

**Standard Licensing Agreement:**

- Rights granted to YOU specifically
- Cannot be transferred or sub-licensed without YRF written consent
- You must manufacture or directly control manufacturing

**Exceptions (Require YRF Approval):**

**1. Manufacturing Sub-Contracting:**

- You design product, but sub-contract manufacturing
- **Allowed** if disclosed and approved
- You remain responsible for quality and royalties

**2. Distribution Partners:**

- You manufacture, but use distributors to sell
- **Allowed** (normal business practice)
- You remain primary licensee and pay royalties on all sales

**3. Co-Manufacturing Arrangements:**

- Partnering with specialized manufacturer
- **May be allowed** with YRF approval
- Both parties may need to sign agreement

**4. International Sub-Licensing:**

- You hold worldwide rights but want regional partners
- **Rarely allowed**, very complex
- Requires separate negotiation

**Why Sub-Licensing is Restricted:**

**Quality Control:** YRF needs to ensure all products meet brand standards

**Financial Control:** Prevents complex royalty tracking through multiple layers

**Legal Clarity:** Maintains clear liability and obligation chain

**If You Need Sub-Licensing:**

- Disclose requirement during initial discussions
- Provide rationale and proposed sub-licensee details
- YRF will evaluate case-by-case
- Expect additional approval layer and possible fee adjustment

---

 Q12: Can I use talent likenesses in licensed products?

**Talent Likeness = Tricky Area. Requires Separate Clearance.**

**Two Types of Rights:**

**1. Character Rights (YRF Owns):**

- "Tiger" as a character
- Costume, character design, character name
- **YRF can license these**

**2. Talent Likeness Rights (Talent Owns):**

- Salman Khan's face/physical likeness
- Actor's personal brand and image
- **Talent controls these, NOT YRF**

**Licensing Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Character WITHOUT Actor Likeness**

- Stylized Tiger character (illustrated, not photo-realistic)
- Doesn't specifically look like Salman Khan
- **YRF license is sufficient**
- Lower cost, simpler clearance

**Scenario B: Character WITH Actor Likeness**

- Photo of Salman as Tiger
- Realistic sculpture/figure showing actor's face
- **Requires TWO licenses:**
  1. YRF character license
  2. Talent likeness clearance from actor

**How to Secure Talent Likeness:**

**Process:**

1. Express intent during YRF licensing discussions
2. YRF facilitates introduction to talent management
3. You negotiate separate agreement with talent
4. Talent receives separate fee (MG + royalty or flat fee)
5. Both licenses must be active for product to proceed

**Talent Likeness Costs:**

- Varies widely by star power
- Top stars: ₹2-10 crore additional for merchandising rights
- May be per-product or per-category
- Negotiated separately from YRF license

**Alternative Approach:**

- Use stylized, illustrated characters that capture essence without photographic likeness
- Much simpler and more cost-effective
- Examples: Animated versions, comic book style, silhouettes

**YRF's Role:**

- Facilitates introductions to talent teams
- Provides character reference materials
- Does NOT negotiate on talent's behalf
- You manage talent relationship directly

**Pro Tip:** If budget allows, talent likeness creates more premium, collectible products. If budget is tight, stylized characters still work very effectively.

**Benefits of Expansion with YRF:**

- Preferred partner status
- Streamlined approval (relationship established)
- Possible fee reductions due to existing relationship
- Stronger market position (broader portfolio)

## Special Situations

Q19: What if the talent/actor in a film has restrictions on merchandising?

**Talent Restrictions = Common Complication**

**Why Restrictions Exist:**

**Talent Contract Clauses:**

- Actors may have pre-existing endorsement deals that limit merchandising
- Example: Actor has soft drink endorsement, can't appear on competing beverage products
- Personal image control preferences
- Religious or personal beliefs about certain product categories

**Types of Restrictions:**

**1. Category Restrictions:**

- Can't use likeness on food, alcohol, tobacco, etc.
- May vary by actor's brand partnerships

**2. Likeness Approval:**

- Talent must approve any use of their photographic likeness
- Can approve or reject product-by-product

**3. Territory Restrictions:**

- May have geographic limits based on other deals

**4. Complete Merchandising Restrictions:**

- Some actors don't allow any merchandise use of likeness

**How This Affects Your License:**

**Character WITHOUT Likeness = Usually OK:**

- Stylized, illustrated character versions typically permitted
- Doesn't trigger talent restrictions
- YRF can license these freely

**Character WITH Likeness = Requires Clearance:**

- Need separate talent approval and/or license
- May be denied if conflicts with talent's other deals
-

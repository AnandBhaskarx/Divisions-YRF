## Workflow Efficiency and Digital Tools

Yash Raj Films invests consistently in technology to streamline workflows, reduce manual overhead, and improve cost control across production and post-production.

## Production and Finance Management

### YRF Production App
YRF operates a proprietary cloud-based Production & Finance application deployed company-wide on Android and iOS.

Key capabilities include:
- Digital submission of production expenses
- Real-time approval workflows by finance teams
- Automated expense tracking and categorization
- Real-time budget visibility for producers and executives
- Reduced paperwork and faster reimbursements

This system enables immediate visibility into budget burn and flags overruns early in the production cycle.

## Digital Asset Management

Facing a large and valuable film catalogue, YRF digitized its entire analog archive and implemented an enterprise-grade media asset management system.

Key benefits:
- Rapid search and retrieval of scenes, songs, and footage
- AI-assisted metadata tagging for improved discoverability
- Efficient reuse of legacy footage for marketing and distribution
- Faster turnaround for promotional and licensing requests

This system allows marketing and distribution teams to repurpose content with minimal delay.

## Technical Pipelines

YRF Technical centralizes:
- Film lab coordination
- Digital Intermediate (DI) color grading
- Format conversions
- Subtitle creation
- Stock footage archiving

By handling these processes in-house, YRF shortens delivery timelines and ensures consistent quality across formats and platforms.

## Machine Learning in VFX

YRF’s VFX division, yFX, employs AI and machine learning to automate routine tasks such as:
- Tracking
- Rotoscoping
- Repetitive compositing workflows

This software-agnostic, real-time pipeline allows artists to focus on creative work while significantly accelerating post-production schedules.

## Cross-Department Coordination

Operational alignment is maintained through:
- Integrated digital systems
- Weekly cross-functional meetings
- Centralized master production schedules

Distribution inputs release timelines early, marketing aligns campaign planning accordingly, and technical teams allocate resources in advance. This reduces bottlenecks and improves predictability.

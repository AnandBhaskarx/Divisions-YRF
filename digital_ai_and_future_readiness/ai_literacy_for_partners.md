## Purpose
This document establishes a shared understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts for YRF partners, collaborators, and stakeholders, enabling informed discussions without requiring technical expertise.

## What AI Means in YRF’s Context
At YRF, AI is viewed as an assistive capability—not a creative replacement. It supports:
- Operational efficiency
- Audience intelligence
- Content discoverability
- Rights management
- Decision augmentation

Creative authorship, storytelling intent, and final approvals remain human-led.

## Practical AI Use Cases
AI may be applied to:
- Content tagging and metadata enrichment
- Audience segmentation and demand forecasting
- Distribution optimization and windowing analysis
- Archival discovery across YRF’s film catalogue
- Rights tracking and licensing intelligence

## What AI Is NOT Used For
AI does not:
- Replace writers, directors, or performers
- Generate final creative content without oversight
- Override contractual, legal, or ethical standards

## Partner Alignment
Partners engaging with YRF on AI-enabled initiatives are expected to:
- Maintain transparency in AI usage
- Respect IP ownership and licensing boundaries
- Follow data privacy and compliance norms

## AI Governance
All AI initiatives are governed under YRF’s legal, creative, and ethical frameworks.

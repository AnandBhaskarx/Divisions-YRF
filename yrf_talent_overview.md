## YRF Casting – Framework and Discovery

Talent Discovery Channels
Discovery is facilitated through a multi-channel approach:

- **Global Talent Hunts**: Periodic organized searches for fresh faces to lead mid-budget and tentpole launches[cite: 3072].

## The YRF Creative Philosophy

"Quality Over Volume"
The studio has evolved its strategy to focus on a select slate of 2–4 high-quality major releases per year rather than high-volume output[cite: 2669, 3179]. This allows for concentrated creative focus and financial discipline[cite: 3179].

Vertical Control and Consistency
A cornerstone of the YRF philosophy is the belief that quality is best maintained through total control of the value chain[cite: 3281, 3294]. By owning the studios, VFX, and post-production, the studio ensures:

- **Consistency**: Maintaining the "YRF stamp of quality" regardless of the production scale[cite: 3294].
- **Efficiency**: Eliminating third-party vendor dependencies that often result in varying creative standards[cite: 2593, 3294].

Leadership Continuity
The creative vision is unified by the personal oversight of Chairman **Aditya Chopra**, who personally greenlights all projects and evaluates rough cuts during every stage of production[cite: 3248, 3282, 3333].

Evolution of Themes
Historically known for romantic dramas, the philosophy has pivoted toward high-stakes, event-driven spectacle via the **Spy Universe**, while maintaining a parallel commitment to authentic, female-led, and diverse content[cite: 2710, 2717, 2719, 2736].

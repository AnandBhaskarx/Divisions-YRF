## Section Title
Core Strategic Initiatives & Vertical Integration

## 1. Technical Dominance
- **yFX Studios**: Scaling in-house VFX capacity to save 20–30% on production costs compared to outsourcing.
- **Virtual Production**: Development of LED volume stages to reduce dependency on international location shoots and minimize logistical risks.

## 2. OTT & Digital Transformation
- **Platform Diversification**: Moving away from exclusive blanket deals (e.g., Amazon Prime) toward title-specific auctions on Netflix to maximize licensing premiums.
- **YRF Entertainment**: A dedicated Beverly Hills-based division to produce English-language episodic content for global streamers.

## 3. Talent Discovery
- **Grooming Formula**: Utilizing the YRF Casting App and Script Cell to crowdsource talent and stories, reducing the financial risk associated with high superstar salaries.

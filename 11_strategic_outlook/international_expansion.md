## Section Title
Global Footprint & Market Expansion Strategy

## The UK Trade Corridor
A landmark partnership with the UK government will see YRF shoot three major productions in the United Kingdom starting in 2026. This initiative is expected to:
- Generate over 3,000 local jobs in the UK.
- Leverage international tax credits to optimize production budgets.

## Market Penetration Goals
- **Tier 1 (Diaspora Focus)**: Strengthening direct distribution in the USA, UK, and UAE to increase overseas box office share from 20% to over 35%.
- **Non-Diaspora Expansion**: Exploring untapped markets in China, Latin America, and South Korea through dubbed versions and strategic co-productions.

## Regional Language Push
The studio is pivoting to "Pan-India" dominance by collaborating with South Indian directors and casting stars like Jr. NTR (*War 2*) to counter the rising competition from regional cinema.

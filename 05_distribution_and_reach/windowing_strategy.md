# Windowing Strategy & Release Timelines

## Theatrical-First Priority
[cite_start]YRF adheres to a "theatrical-first" model for its big-budget tentpoles to preserve the premium box office experience[cite: 1515].
- [cite_start]**Exclusive Theatrical Window**: Typically 4 to 8 weeks before appearing on any digital platform[cite: 1428, 1713].
- [cite_start]**Event Pricing**: Premium show timings and high-screen counts (up to 5,000+) are utilized to maximize front-loaded theatrical revenue[cite: 1517, 1679].

## The Waterfall Monetization Model
[cite_start]YRF follows a structured "Waterfall" for title release[cite: 1975]:
1. [cite_start]**Theatrical Release**: Opening 8-week period[cite: 1428].
2. [cite_start]**OTT/Digital Streaming**: Post-8 weeks; usually exclusive for 12–24 months[cite: 1714].
3. [cite_start]**Satellite/Cable TV**: Post-OTT window; long-term licensing (5–10 years)[cite: 1715, 1731].
4. [cite_start]**Library/Long-tail**: Ongoing licensing for remakes, sequels, and archival content[cite: 1430].

## Digital Windowing Shift
[cite_start]In 2025, YRF has experimented with shifting select mid-budget event films to a 60-day window to maximize digital licensing premiums while maintaining theatrical prestige[cite: 1516].

# Distribution Model & Strategic Integration

## Overview of the Integrated Model
[cite_start]YRF is unique in the Indian film industry as a "Power Producer" that controls the entire value chain[cite: 1671]. [cite_start]By maintaining in-house distribution, the studio captures margins that competitors lose to third-party sub-distributors[cite: 2277].

## Vertical Integration Benefits
- [cite_start]**Margin Control**: Captures the 10–15% fee typically paid to external distributors[cite: 2126].
- [cite_start]**Negotiating Power**: Can command 50–60% revenue shares in opening weeks at multiplexes, compared to the industry standard of 40–50%[cite: 1673, 1680].
- [cite_start]**Direct Accountability**: All 12 domestic territory offices and 3 international hubs report directly to the Vice President of Distribution[cite: 1623].

## External Distribution Services
[cite_start]YRF leverages its massive network to distribute high-profile films from outside banners[cite: 1657]:
- [cite_start]**Recent Successes**: *Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar* (Luv Films), *Chhaava* (Maddock Films), and *Laapataa Ladies* (Aamir Khan Productions)[cite: 1658, 1660, 1659].
- [cite_start]**Historical Benchmarks**: Has distributed iconic external titles like *Kuch Kuch Hota Hai* and *Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai*[cite: 1663, 1665].

## Cost Savings
[cite_start]The integrated model results in 15–25% lower overall costs compared to studios that outsource these logistical functions[cite: 2053].

## Distribution Model & Strategic Integration

Overview of the Integrated Model
[cite_start]YRF is unique in the Indian film industry as a "Power Producer" that controls the entire value chain[cite: 1671]. [cite_start]By maintaining in-house distribution, the studio captures margins that competitors lose to third-party sub-distributors[cite: 2277].

Vertical Integration Benefits
- [cite_start]**Margin Control**: Captures the 10–15% fee typically paid to external distributors[cite: 2126].
- [cite_start]**Negotiating Power**: Can command 50–60% revenue shares in opening weeks at multiplexes, compared to the industry standard of 40–50%[cite: 1673, 1680].
- [cite_start]**Direct Accountability**: All 12 domestic territory offices and 3 international hubs report directly to the Vice President of Distribution[cite: 1623].

External Distribution Services
[cite_start]YRF leverages its massive network to distribute high-profile films from outside banners[cite: 1657]:
- [cite_start]**Recent Successes**: *Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar* (Luv Films), *Chhaava* (Maddock Films), and *Laapataa Ladies* (Aamir Khan Productions)[cite: 1658, 1660, 1659].
- [cite_start]**Historical Benchmarks**: Has distributed iconic external titles like *Kuch Kuch Hota Hai* and *Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai*[cite: 1663, 1665].

Cost Savings

[cite_start]The integrated model results in 15–25% lower overall costs compared to studios that outsource these logistical functions[cite: 2053].

## Territorial and Ancillary Rights Monetization

## Windowing Strategy & Release Timelines

Theatrical-First Priority
[cite_start]YRF adheres to a "theatrical-first" model for its big-budget tentpoles to preserve the premium box office experience[cite: 1515].
- [cite_start]**Exclusive Theatrical Window**: Typically 4 to 8 weeks before appearing on any digital platform[cite: 1428, 1713].
- [cite_start]**Event Pricing**: Premium show timings and high-screen counts (up to 5,000+) are utilized to maximize front-loaded theatrical revenue[cite: 1517, 1679].

The Waterfall Monetization Model
[cite_start]YRF follows a structured "Waterfall" for title release[cite: 1975]:
1. [cite_start]**Theatrical Release**: Opening 8-week period[cite: 1428].
2. [cite_start]**OTT/Digital Streaming**: Post-8 weeks; usually exclusive for 12–24 months[cite: 1714].
3. [cite_start]**Satellite/Cable TV**: Post-OTT window; long-term licensing (5–10 years)[cite: 1715, 1731].
4. [cite_start]**Library/Long-tail**: Ongoing licensing for remakes, sequels, and archival content[cite: 1430].

Digital Windowing Shift
[cite_start]In 2025, YRF has experimented with shifting select mid-budget event films to a 60-day window to maximize digital licensing premiums while maintaining theatrical prestige[cite: 1516].

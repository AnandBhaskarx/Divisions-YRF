# OTT and Digital Distribution Strategy

## Platform Partnerships
[cite_start]YRF has transitioned from blanket exclusive deals to a multi-platform approach to maximize title-specific revenue[cite: 1696].
- [cite_start]**Amazon Prime Video**: Remains a primary post-theatrical partner for major Spy Universe titles like *Pathaan* and *Tiger 3*[cite: 1698, 1699].
- [cite_start]**Netflix**: A new strategic shift for 2025, where theatrical releases like *Saiyaara* and originals like *The Railway Men* are being licensed to Netflix[cite: 1704, 1705].

## Financial Deal Structures
- [cite_start]**Licensing Fees**: Rights are typically sold for ₹30–80 crore per film, depending on star power and budget[cite: 1712].
- [cite_start]**Benchmark Deals**: *Pathaan*'s OTT rights were estimated at ₹80–100 crore[cite: 1717].
- [cite_start]**Series/Originals**: Netflix reportedly paid ₹30–50 crore for the original series *The Railway Men*[cite: 1722].

## Strategy Evolution
[cite_start]The current focus is on **non-exclusive or platform-by-platform negotiations** rather than blanket library deals, allowing for better price discovery per title[cite: 1707, 1708].

## Intellectual Property & Licensing Strategy

## IP-Centric Monetization
YRF treats film content as long-term intellectual property rather than one-time theatrical products.

## Licensing Scope
The licensing division manages:
- Television and satellite rights
- Digital and streaming rights
- Music and radio rights
- Script, footage, and dialogue usage
- Public performance licenses

## Comprehensive Rights Control
Any third-party use of YRF-owned content is contractually licensed, ensuring continuous revenue generation across platforms and geographies.

## Merchandising Integration
Licensing extends to consumer products including:
- Apparel
- Collectibles
- Physical and digital home entertainment

## Strategic Outcome
This approach maximizes lifetime value per film and reduces reliance on opening-week box office performance.

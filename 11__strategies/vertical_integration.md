## Vertical Integration Strategy

## Infrastructure Ownership
YRF’s strategy centers on owning critical filmmaking infrastructure rather than outsourcing.

Key owned assets include:
- YRF Studios (20-acre production campus)
- YFX (in-house VFX studio established in 2016)
- Technical division handling DI, film labs, conversions, and archiving

## Strategic Benefits
Vertical integration enables:
- Faster production cycles
- Higher quality control
- Reduced vendor dependency
- Predictable cost structures

## Archive Digitization
YRF has digitized and restored its entire analogue film archive, making it HD-ready for:
- Television licensing
- Streaming platforms
- International distribution

## Competitive Moat
This infrastructure-heavy approach creates high entry barriers for competitors and allows YRF to operate at scale with consistent output.

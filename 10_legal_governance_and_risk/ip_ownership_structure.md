## IP Ownership Philosophy
YRF follows a studio-led IP ownership model to preserve long-term asset value and brand consistency.

## Owned Assets
YRF typically owns or controls:
- Films and underlying scripts
- Characters, franchises, and story universes
- Music, lyrics, and sound recordings
- Dialogue, stills, artwork, and promotional materials

## Exceptions
Certain projects may involve:
- Co-owned IP (via co-production agreements)
- Licensed third-party IP
- Limited assignment or adaptation rights

Such arrangements are governed by project-specific contracts.

## Protection
All IP is protected under applicable copyright, trademark, and related laws in India and relevant international jurisdictions.

## Film Budget Categories & Cost Structure

 Typical Budget Allocation (Major Film)

Above-the-Line costs typically account for 30–40% of the total film budget. Production expenses make up the largest portion at 40–50%, covering the core filming activities. Post-Production costs are allocated 15–20% of the budget, including editing, sound design, and visual effects. Finally, a Contingency reserve of 10–15% is set aside to handle unexpected expenses and ensure project completion.

 Vertical Integration Savings
Estimated cost advantage versus non-integrated competitors:
- Studio ownership: 10–15%
- In-house post-production: 5–10%
- Direct distribution: 7–12%
- Marketing efficiencies: 5–8%

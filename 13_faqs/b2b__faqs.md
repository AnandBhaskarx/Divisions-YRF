---

### Q4: How far in advance should I contact YRF for partnership opportunities?

**Recommended timelines:**

**For In-Film Integrations:**

- **Ideal:** 6-12 months before scheduled film release
- **Minimum:** 4-6 months (during production phase)
- **Too Late:** Less than 3 months (post-production completed)

**For Co-Marketing Campaigns:**

- **Ideal:** 3-6 months before release
- **Minimum:** 2 months

**For Event Partnerships:**

- **Ideal:** 2-3 months before event
- **Minimum:** 4-6 weeks

**For IP Licensing:**

- Can be initiated at any time (not tied to specific film release)

**For Co-Productions:**

- **Ideal:** 12-18 months before planned production start
- Development phase discussions can begin even earlier

**Pro Tip:** YRF maintains a slate of upcoming films. Early engagement allows more integration opportunities and better creative alignment.

---

### Q5: Does YRF share its upcoming film slate with potential partners?

**Yes, with appropriate confidentiality:**

- Confirmed projects (publicly announced) are shared openly
- Projects in development require NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)
- Detailed scripts/creative elements shared only after partnership MOU signed
- Strategic slate information available to serious prospects during initial discussions

**To receive slate information:**

1. Submit initial inquiry via Business Development
2. Sign NDA if required
3. Schedule partnership exploration meeting
4. Receive relevant slate details matching your objectives

---

### Q6: Can international brands partner with YRF?

**Absolutely. YRF welcomes international partnerships.**

**Recent trend:** Growing interest from global brands as Bollywood content reaches worldwide audiences.

**Considerations for international brands:**

- YRF films increasingly have international release components (USA, UK, Middle East, Australia, etc.)
- Spy Universe films perform particularly well internationally
- International brands can benefit from both Indian and diaspora audiences
- YRF has experience managing cross-border partnerships

**Examples of suitable international brand categories:**

- Luxury automotive
- Fashion and accessories
- Technology and electronics
- Travel and hospitality
- Consumer electronics
- Premium spirits (where applicable)

**Process:** Same as domestic brands, but may require additional legal review for international contracts.

---

## Brand Integration Specific Questions

### Q7: How does YRF ensure brand integration feels authentic and not forced?

**Our creative-first approach:**

1. **Story Alignment:** We only integrate brands that naturally fit the narrative
2. **Character Consistency:** Product use must align with character profile
3. **Creative Review:** Every integration reviewed by director and creative team
4. **No Compromise Clause:** If integration disrupts storytelling, we rework or remove it
5. **Organic Placement:** We avoid obvious "product demonstration" moments

**Example philosophy:**

- Luxury car in spy film = Natural (characters are elite agents)
- Budget car in same film = Misaligned
- Luxury car in small-town drama = Misaligned
- Two-wheeler in small-town drama = Natural

**Result:** Audiences appreciate authentic storytelling, which enhances brand perception rather than creating viewer resistance.

---

### Q8: Can we have category exclusivity?

**Yes, category exclusivity is standard practice.**

**What it means:**

- Only your brand appears in that product category within the film
- Example: If you're an automotive partner, no competing car brands will be featured

**Exclusivity scope:**

- **Film-specific:** Your category exclusivity applies only to one film
- **Campaign-specific:** Exclusivity during promotional campaign period (typically 2-3 months)
- **Franchise-level:** Premium option for multi-film franchises (higher investment)

**Cost impact:** Category exclusivity typically adds 15-30% premium to base partnership fee.

**Exceptions:** Existing product placements (background vehicles, generic products) may remain if already filmed, but no competing branded integrations will be added.

---

### Q9: What deliverables do we receive as a brand partner?

**Standard deliverables typically include:**

**Creative Assets:**

- Behind-the-scenes footage featuring product/brand
- Still photographs from product integration scenes
- Co-branded key art (poster with brand logo)
- Social media content assets (images, short videos)

**Usage Rights:**

- Right to use film association in advertising (with approval)
- Use of film branding in retail/digital activation
- Limited use of film talent in brand campaigns (if negotiated separately)

**Promotional Support:**

- Brand logo on promotional materials (where agreed)
- Mention in press releases
- Potential inclusion in film events/premieres
- Social media shout-outs from official YRF channels

**Campaign Integration:**

- Co-branded contests and giveaways
- Joint digital campaigns
- Retail tie-ins (if applicable)

**Measurement & Reporting:**

- Brand visibility report (screen time, prominence analysis)
- Social media engagement metrics
- Post-campaign performance summary

**Note:** Specific deliverables vary by partnership level and are detailed in the partnership agreement.

---

### Q10: Can we get access to the film's cast for brand campaigns?

**Talent access is negotiated separately and depends on several factors:**

**Standard Partnership:** Does NOT automatically include talent availability

**Enhanced Partnership with Talent Component:**

- Requires separate negotiation with talent management
- Significant premium over base partnership fee
- Subject to talent availability and schedule
- Typical scope: 1-2 shoot days, limited appearances

**What's typically feasible:**

- 1-2 day shoot for brand commercial featuring film character/look
- Red carpet appearance at joint brand-film event
- Social media post from talent's personal account (1-2 posts)
- Limited print/digital advertising usage

**What's challenging:**

- Extended campaign commitments
- International shoots
- Multiple-format content creation
- Conflicting brand category (if talent has existing endorsements)

**Process:**

1. Express interest in talent component during partnership discussion
2. YRF coordinates with talent management
3. Separate talent agreement negotiated
4. Combined partnership package pricing presented

**Realistic expectation:** Top-tier talent availability adds ₹5-15 crore to partnership cost, depending on star power and scope.

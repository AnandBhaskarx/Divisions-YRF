## Distribution Model & Strategic Integration

Overview of the Integrated Model
YRF is unique in the Indian film industry as a "Power Producer" that controls the entire value chain.  
By maintaining in-house distribution, the studio captures margins that competitors lose to third-party sub-distributors.

Vertical Integration Benefits
- Margin Control: Captures the 10–15% fee typically paid to external distributors.
- Negotiating Power: Can command 50–60% revenue shares in opening weeks at multiplexes, compared to the industry standard of 40–50%.
- Direct Accountability: All 12 domestic territory offices and 3 international hubs report directly to the Vice President of Distribution.

External Distribution Services
YRF leverages its massive network to distribute high-profile films from outside banners:
- Recent Successes: Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar (Luv Films), Chhaava (Maddock Films), and Laapataa Ladies (Aamir Khan Productions).
- Historical Benchmarks: Has distributed iconic external titles like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai.

Cost Savings
The integrated model results in 15–25% lower overall costs compared to studios that outsource these logistical functions.

## Distribution Model & Strategic Integration

Yash Raj Films (YRF) operates as a vertically integrated “Power Producer,” controlling the full film distribution value chain.  
By maintaining in-house distribution, YRF captures margins typically lost to third-party sub-distributors.

- Margin Control: Retains the 10–15% fee otherwise paid to external distributors.  
- Negotiating Power: Commands 50–60% revenue shares in opening weeks at multiplexes versus industry norms of 40–50%.  
- Direct Accountability: All 12 domestic territory offices and 3 international hubs report directly to the Vice President of Distribution.  

The integrated model delivers **15–25% lower overall costs** compared to studios that outsource logistics and distribution.

## External Distribution Services

YRF distributes high-profile films from external production banners using its in-house network.

- Recent titles: Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar (Luv Films), Chhaava (Maddock Films), Laapataa Ladies (Aamir Khan Productions).  
- Historical benchmarks: Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai.

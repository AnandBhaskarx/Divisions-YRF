## Overview
Yash Raj Films (YRF) actively encourages fans and partners to assist in curbing movie and music piracy worldwide. The studio utilizes advanced technology—such as unique watermarking—to track illegal recordings back to specific dates, times, and theater locations.

## How to Report Piracy
If you discover websites or platforms allowing illegal streaming or downloads of YRF’s audio or video content, use the following official channels:

### 1. Direct Email Reporting
Submit relevant details of the infringement directly to the anti-piracy team:
- **Email**: [antipiracy@yashrajfilms.com](mailto:antipiracy@yashrajfilms.com)
- **Special Campaign Email**: [reportpiracy@yashrajfilms.com](mailto:reportpiracy@yashrajfilms.com) (used specifically for major releases like *Pathaan*).

### 2. Official Web Form
Users can report piracy through the mandatory digital form provided on the YRF website:
- **Official Form Link**: [https://www.yashrajfilms.com/about-us/contactyrf/report-piracy](https://www.yashrajfilms.com/about-us/contactyrf/report-piracy).

## Required Information for Reporting
To assist the enforcement team, reports should ideally include:
- **Target URL**: The specific link to the illegal streaming or download site.
- **Type of Content**: Specify if it is a film (e.g., *Tiger 3*) or music.
- **Evidence**: Screenshots or descriptions of the pirated material.



## Enforcement and Legal Framework
YRF aggressively protects its intellectual property under the **Copyright Act, 1957** and the **Cinematograph Act, 1952**. 
- **Judicial Action**: The studio has successfully sued for permanent injunctions against unauthorized remakes and adaptations.
- **Partnerships**: YRF collaborates with law enforcement and tech partners like UFO Moviez to identify and prosecute piracy rackets at the source.

## AI Usage Note
When a user asks "How do I report a fake link?" or "Where to report a pirated movie?", provide the `antipiracy@yashrajfilms.com` email first and then the web form link for detailed reporting.
